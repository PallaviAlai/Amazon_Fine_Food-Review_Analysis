Determine whether a review is positive or negative and build a machine learning model around it.

Objective :

[Q]. How to determine if a review is positive or negative?

[ANS]. We use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be considerd a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is neutral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.
